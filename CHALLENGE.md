# Interview Challenge

This challenge is designed thoughtfully as follows;

1. First and foremost, by completing this task we intend to give you a realistic preview of
the Staff Engineer opportunity at ScreenCloud and the sorts of tasks that you are
likely to encounter - this is really important to us!
2. We’d like to see how you respond to the tasks that would come with this work, but
we’re not looking for perfection, neither are we looking for you to get all the details
exactly right - you aren’t (yet!) a ScreenClouder, therefore we don’t expect you to have
the inside scoop.

## ScreenCloud Order Management System

ScreenCloud’s SCOS device is becoming increasingly popular, and to make sure we can handle
future demand, we have decided to introduce a new order management system for our sales
team.

## SCOS Device information

Name SCOS Station P1 Pro
Price $150
Weight 365g
Volume discount • 25+ units: 5% discount
• 50+ units: 10% discount
• 100+ units: 15% discount
• 250+ units: 20% discount

The device ships from 6 different warehouses around the world. Below is a list of warehouses
with geographical location and current stock.

### Warehouses and stock

Name Coordinates (latitude/longitude) Stock
Los Angeles 33.9425, -118.408056 355
New York 40.639722, -73.778889 578
São Paulo -23.435556, -46.473056 265
Paris 49.009722, 2.547778 694
Warsaw 52.165833, 20.967222 245
Hong Kong 22.308889, 113.914444 419

The cost of shipping an order is calculated based on the geographical distance between the
warehouse and the shipping address, and the weight of the shipment. The rate is $0.01 per
kilogram per kilometer.

A single order can be shipped from multiple warehouses. For example, if one warehouse does
not have enough stock to fulfill the order, remaining units can be shipped from other
warehouses. However, we always want the cost to be as low as possible. If shipping cost
exceeds 15% of the order amount after discount, the order is considered invalid and should not
be processed.

Your task is to design and implement the backend of the system.

## Functional requirements

● A sales rep should be able to verify a potential order without submitting it, by inputting
the number of devices and coordinates (latitude/longitude) of the shipping address.
The rep should be able to see total price, discount and shipping cost, as well as an
indication of the order’s validity.
● A sales rep should be able to submit an order by inputting the number of devices and
coordinates (latitude/longitude) of the shipping address. A successful order submission
should result in warehouse inventory immediately being updated. The order must have
an order number and store total price, discount and shipping cost as calculated at the
time of submission.

## Technical requirements

● The solution should be implemented in Typescript, and store data in a database. In the
follow-up interview, we’ll discuss your choices and thought processes behind your
solution.
● The solution should expose its capabilities through a well-documented API.
● Extensive test coverage is not required, but a clear testing strategy should be
demonstrated.
● You are free to use any libraries or frameworks. However, we recommend avoiding
opinionated application frameworks like NestJS, as our goal is to evaluate your
approach to designing the architecture and organizing the codebase.
● Approach the solution like you would a production system, and consider aspects such
as performance, scalability, consistency and extensibility.
● It should be trivial to start the application and run tests in a local environment.
● Deploying the application to a cloud provider and demonstrating the use of a CD/CI
pipeline is a plus.

There are two options for submitting the challenge:

1. Push the code to a public Github repo and email Imogen (imogen.king@screencloud.io)
the link.
2. If you prefer the submission to be private, zip the project dir, upload it to
https://wetransfer.com/ and email Imogen (imogen.king@screencloud.io) the link.
Let us know if you have any questions. And happy coding!
